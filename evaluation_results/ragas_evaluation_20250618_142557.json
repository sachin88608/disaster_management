      "question": "What caused the tsunami event near E. Sporades Islands recorded in 330 B.C.?",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, there is no information about a tsunami event near E. Sporades Islands recorded in 330 B.C. The context documents only provide information about tsunami events that occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nTherefore, I must rely on my general knowledge to provide an answer. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any specific information about a tsunami near E. Sporades Islands in 330 B.C. It's possible that such an event may not be well-documented or may not have been recorded in historical records.\n\nIf you are looking for information on tsunami events in general, I can provide some general knowledge. Tsunamis can be caused by earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, or meteorite impacts that displace large amounts of water. The likelihood and impact of a tsunami event depend on various factors such as the size of the triggering event, the distance from the coast, and the shape of the seafloor.\n\nIn terms of actionable advice, if you are looking for information on tsunami risks and preparedness, I can suggest some general steps:\n\n1. Check if you live in a coastal area that is prone to tsunamis.\n2. Familiarize yourself with evacuation routes and warning systems in your area.\n3. Practice evacuation drills with your family and community exercises.\n4. Stay informed about weather and tsunami warnings through local news and authorities.\n\nPlease note that these are general suggestions and may not be specific to the E. Sporades Islands or the 330 B.C. event.",

The context primarily focuses on tsunami science, warning systems, and hazard maps.\n\nTherefore, I must rely on my general knowledge to provide an answer. NASA's involvement in tsunami disaster response is not a well-known program. However, NASA does have a role in disaster response, particularly through its Earth Science Division, which provides satellite data and analysis for disaster response and recovery efforts.\n\nIn the context of tsunami response, NASA's primary goal would likely be to provide satellite data and analysis to support tsunami warning and response efforts. This could include providing satellite imagery to assess tsunami damage, detecting tsunami waves, and supporting evacuation efforts.\n\nActionable advice: In the event of a tsunami warning, it is essential to follow evacuation instructions from local authorities and stay away from coastal areas. Staying informed through trusted sources, like the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, can help individuals make informed decisions during a tsunami event.\n\nPlease note that the answer is based on general knowledge and not on the provided context.",

The context documents primarily contain data about flood events, including the cause, location, and impact of each event. However, I can supplement this information with my general knowledge.\n\nThe four stages in the life cycle of a tropical cyclone are:\n\n1. **Tropical Disturbance**: This is the formation of a low-pressure system over warm tropical waters, typically within 20\u00b0 of the equator. This stage is characterized by thunderstorms and strong winds.\n\n2. **Tropical Depression**: If the tropical disturbance strengthens, it becomes a tropical depression, which is a rotating system of clouds and thunderstorms that has sustained winds of 38 mph (61 km/h) or less.\n\n3. **Tropical Storm**: If the tropical depression continues to strengthen, it becomes a tropical storm, which is a rotating system of clouds and thunderstorms that has sustained winds of 39-73 mph (63-118 km/h).\n\n4. **Hurricane/Typhoon**: If the tropical storm continues to strengthen, it becomes a hurricane or typhoon, which is a rotating system of clouds and thunderstorms that has sustained winds of 74 mph (119 km/h) or higher.\n\nActionable advice: It's essential to monitor weather forecasts and warnings from trusted sources, such as the National Hurricane Center (NHC) or local meteorological agencies, to stay informed about the development and progression of tropical cyclones. This information can help individuals and communities prepare for and respond to these potentially devastating events.\n\nPlease note that the information about the four stages of a tropical cyclone comes from my general knowledge, as the context documents do not provide this information.",

      "question": "What is ShakeMap used for?",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, ShakeMap is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I must rely on my general knowledge to answer this question.\n\nShakeMap is a product of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that provides a map of the intensity of shaking caused by an earthquake. It is used to estimate the severity of shaking at a given location, which helps emergency managers, first responders, and the public to quickly understand the potential impact of an earthquake and respond accordingly.\n\nIn the context of disaster management and emergency response, ShakeMap can be used to:\n\n* Identify areas of high shaking intensity, which can help emergency responders prioritize their response efforts\n* Estimate the likelihood of damage to buildings, infrastructure, and other critical facilities\n* Inform evacuation decisions and shelter needs\n* Support damage assessments and resource allocation\n\nWhile the provided context does not mention ShakeMap specifically, it does highlight the importance of preparing for earthquakes and other hazards listed. It is essential for individuals, communities, and organizations to develop emergency plans, build kits, and stay informed to minimize the impact of disasters.\n\nActionable advice: If you live in an earthquake-prone area, consider creating a family emergency plan, practicing earthquake drills, and staying informed about earthquake risk in your area.",
