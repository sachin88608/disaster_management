# Earthquake Safety and Preparedness Guide

## What is an Earthquake?
An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.

## Before an Earthquake:
1. **Prepare an Emergency Kit**: Include water, food, flashlights, batteries, first aid supplies, medications, and important documents.

2. **Secure Your Home**: 
   - Bolt tall furniture to walls
   - Install latches on cabinets
   - Secure water heater and gas appliances
   - Identify safe spots in each room

3. **Create a Family Emergency Plan**:
   - Designate meeting places
   - Establish communication methods
   - Practice earthquake drills

4. **Learn About Your Area's Risk**: Understand local seismic activity and building codes.

## During an Earthquake:
1. **Drop, Cover, and Hold On**:
   - Drop to hands and knees
   - Take cover under a sturdy table or desk
   - Hold on to your shelter and protect your head

2. **If You're Outside**: Move away from buildings, trees, and power lines.

3. **If You're Driving**: Pull over safely, avoid bridges and overpasses.

4. **Stay Calm**: Don't run outside during shaking.

## After an Earthquake:
1. **Check for Injuries**: Provide first aid if needed.

2. **Inspect Your Home**: Look for damage to structure and utilities.

3. **Be Prepared for Aftershocks**: They can be as dangerous as the main quake.

4. **Listen to Emergency Information**: Use battery-powered radio for updates.

5. **Help Others**: Assist neighbors and community members if possible.

## Earthquake Magnitude Scale:
- **2.5 or less**: Usually not felt
- **2.5 to 5.4**: Often felt, minor damage
- **5.5 to 6.0**: Slight damage to buildings
- **6.1 to 6.9**: May cause significant damage
- **7.0 to 7.9**: Major earthquake, serious damage
- **8.0 or greater**: Great earthquake, can destroy communities

## Building Safety:
- Modern buildings are designed to withstand earthquakes
- Older buildings may need retrofitting
- Know your building's earthquake resistance
- Identify structural vs. non-structural hazards
