## What is a Flood?
A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. Floods can occur due to heavy rainfall, storm surge, dam failure, or rapid snowmelt.

## Types of Floods:
1. **Flash Floods**: Sudden flooding, usually within 6 hours of heavy rain
2. **River Floods**: Gradual rise in water levels over days or weeks
3. **Urban Floods**: Caused by overwhelmed drainage systems in cities
4. **Coastal Floods**: Result from storm surge, high tides, or tsunamis

## Before a Flood:
1. **Know Your Risk**: 
   - Understand flood zones in your area
   - Learn evacuation routes
   - Sign up for community alert systems

2. **Prepare an Emergency Kit**:
   - Water (1 gallon per person per day for 3 days)
   - Non-perishable food for 3 days
   - Battery-powered radio and flashlights
   - First aid kit and medications
   - Important documents in waterproof container

3. **Protect Your Property**:
   - Install sump pumps and backup power
   - Keep sandbags and plastic sheeting available
   - Elevate utilities above potential flood levels
   - Consider flood insurance

4. **Create a Family Plan**:
   - Designate meeting places
   - Plan evacuation routes
   - Identify higher ground locations

## During a Flood:
1. **Stay Safe**:
   - Never drive through flooded roads
   - Avoid walking in moving water
   - Stay away from downed power lines

2. **Monitor Conditions**:
   - Listen to weather radio or emergency broadcasts
   - Watch for rising water levels
   - Be ready to evacuate quickly

3. **If Evacuating**:
   - Take your emergency kit
   - Follow designated evacuation routes
   - Don't return until authorities say it's safe

## After a Flood:
1. **Safety First**:
   - Avoid flood waters (may be contaminated)
   - Check for structural damage before entering buildings
   - Use generators outside only (carbon monoxide risk)

2. **Document Damage**:
   - Take photos for insurance claims
   - Make temporary repairs to prevent further damage
   - Keep receipts for expenses

3. **Clean Up Safely**:
   - Wear protective gear
   - Discard contaminated materials
   - Disinfect everything that got wet

## Flood Safety Rules:
- **Turn Around, Don't Drown**: Just 6 inches of moving water can knock you down
- **2 feet of water can float a car**: Never drive through flooded roads
- **Stay informed**: Monitor weather and emergency alerts
- **Have multiple ways to receive warnings**: Weather radio, phone alerts, sirens

## Flood Insurance:
- Standard homeowner's insurance doesn't cover floods
- Federal flood insurance has a 30-day waiting period
- Document your belongings with photos/video
- Consider coverage for both building and contents
