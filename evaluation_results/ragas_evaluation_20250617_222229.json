      "question": "What caused the tsunami event near E. Sporades Islands recorded in 330 B.C.?",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, there is no information about a tsunami event near E. Sporades Islands recorded in 330 B.C. The context documents only provide information about tsunami events that occurred between 1853 and 1933, and none of them mention an event near E. Sporades Islands in 330 B.C.\n\nTherefore, I must rely on my general knowledge to provide an answer. Unfortunately, I don't have any specific information about a tsunami event near E. Sporades Islands in 330 B.C. It's possible that it was caused by an earthquake, as earthquakes are a common cause of tsunamis, but without more specific information, it's impossible to say for certain.\n\nActionable advice: If you're looking for information about a specific tsunami event, try searching for reliable sources such as scientific papers, government agencies, or international organizations that specialize in disaster management and emergency response.",

Sedimentary deposits: The researchers analyzed sediment cores and outcrops along the coast to identify tsunami deposits, which are characterized by distinct sedimentary features such as anomalous grain size, and composition.\n2. Coastal geomorphology: The team examined the coastal morphology, including features such as beach ridges, dunes, and coastal erosion, which can be indicative of past tsunami events.\n3. Historical records: The researchers consulted historical documents, such as colonial-era records and newspaper archives, to identify accounts of past tsunami events and their impacts on coastal communities.\n4. Paleoseismology: The study incorporated paleoseismological data, which involves the analysis of sedimentary and geological records to identify past earthquakes and tsunamis, and their recurrence intervals.\n\nThese proxies were used in conjunction with numerical modeling and field observations to reconstruct the tsunami history of the Mexican Pacific coast and identify areas of high tsunami risk.",

The context documents only provide information about floods in India, specifically in the states of Assam and Uttarakhand, between 2001 and 2010.\n\nTherefore, I must rely on my general knowledge to inform you that I couldn't find any notable flood event in Mozambique on December 28, 2008. However, Mozambique is prone to flooding, and it's essential for the authorities and communities to have effective disaster management and emergency response plans in place to mitigate the impact of such events.\n\nActionable advice:\n\n* It's crucial to rely on credible sources of information, such as government agencies, international organizations, and reputable news outlets, to stay informed about flood events and their impacts.\n* Communities in flood-prone areas should develop and regularly practice emergency response plans to minimize the risk of injury, loss of life, and damage to property.\n* Authorities should invest in flood mitigation measures, such as early warning systems, flood-resistant infrastructure, and sustainable land use practices, to reduce the vulnerability of communities to flooding.",

The context documents appear to be a dataset of various factors contributing to flood risk, with each document representing a different scenario or location.\n\nThe documents do provide information on flood probability, but it is not specific to a particular event or location. The flood probability values range from 0.525 to 0.67, indicating a moderate to high likelihood of flooding.\n\nIf I were to provide general knowledge on flood severity, I would suggest that flood severity can be categorized based on factors such as the flood's impact on human life, infrastructure, and the environment. However, this information is not specific to the context documents.\n\nIn the absence of specific information on the flood event, I would recommend the following actionable advice:\n\n1. Consult additional data sources, such as weather reports, news articles, or government agencies' records, to obtain specific information on the flood event in question.\n2. Analyze the factors contributing to flood risk, as listed in the context documents, to better understand the underlying causes of flooding and develop strategies for mitigation and response.\n\nPlease note that my response is limited by the context documents provided, and further information is required to provide a more specific answer.",

However, Document 2 mentions \"RSMC, New Delhi\" which is the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for tropical cyclones over the North Indian Ocean, which is part of the IMD. Additionally, Document 2 mentions \"Cyclone Warning Division\" which is also part of the IMD.\n\nAs per my general knowledge, the IMD is the national meteorological service of India responsible for meteorological, hydrological, and seismological observations, forecasts, and warnings. The IMD plays a critical role in managing cyclonic hazards in India by issuing warnings, advisories, and forecasts to various stakeholders, including the general public, media, and disaster management authorities.\n\nActionable advice: In the event of a cyclone warning, it is essential to stay informed through trusted sources like the IMD, All India Radio (AIR), and local authorities.

However, I can supplement with my general knowledge.\n\nThe four stages in the life cycle of a tropical cyclone are:\n\n1. **Tropical Disturbance**: This is the initial stage where a low-pressure system forms, often with thunderstorms and strong winds. (General knowledge)\n2. **Tropical Depression**: In this stage, the system strengthens, winds reach 38 mph (61 km/h), and the system starts to rotate. (General knowledge)\n3. **Tropical Storm**: When winds reach 39-73 mph (63-118 km/h), the system is classified as a tropical storm. (General knowledge)\n4. **Hurricane/Typhoon**: The final stage occurs when winds exceed 74 mph (119 km/h), and the system becomes a hurricane or typhoon, depending on the location. (General knowledge)\n\nWhile the context documents provide information about tropical cyclones as a cause of floods, they do not describe the life cycle of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, the information provided above is based on my general knowledge.\n\nActionable advice: Understanding the life cycle of a tropical cyclone can help emergency responders and disaster managers prepare for potential floods and other hazards associated with these storms.",

      "question": "What is ShakeMap used for?",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, ShakeMap is not mentioned in the given document from ready.gov. Therefore, I must rely on my general knowledge to answer this question.\n\nShakeMap is a product of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that provides near-real-time maps of ground motion and shaking intensity following significant earthquakes. The maps are used to estimate the severity of shaking and potential damage to buildings, infrastructure, and other structures.\n\nShakeMap is used for various purposes, including:**\n\n1. **Emergency response**: To quickly assess the affected areas and prioritize response efforts.\n2. **Damage assessment**: To estimate the extent of damage to buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure**.\n3. **Search and rescue operations**: To identify areas with potential collapse or hazardous conditions.\n4. **Public information**: To inform the public about the severity of shaking and potential hazards in the affected areas.\n\nWhile the provided context does not mention ShakeMap, it does provide information on earthquake preparedness and response, which is relevant to the use of ShakeMap.\n\nActionable advice: If you live in an earthquake-prone area, familiarize yourself with ShakeMap and its uses. This can help you better understand the severity of an earthquake and take informed decisions during an emergency.",
