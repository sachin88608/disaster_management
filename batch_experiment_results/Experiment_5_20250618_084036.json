The context documents only provide information about tsunami events that occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nTherefore, I must rely on my general knowledge to provide an answer. According to historical records, the tsunami event near E. Sporades Islands in 330 B.C. is believed to have been caused by an earthquake. However, I must emphasize that this information is not supported by the provided context documents.\n\nIf I were to provide actionable advice, it would be to consult additional historical records or scientific studies that specifically focus on ancient tsunami events to gather more accurate and reliable information about the cause of the tsunami event near E.

      "answer": "According to the 2011 study by Ram\u00edrez-Herrera in Mexico, the proxies used to reconstruct the paleotsunami history were:\n\n1. Sedimentary deposits: The study analyzed the sedimentary deposits found in coastal areas, which provided evidence of past tsunami events. The deposits were characterized by their texture, composition, and light minerals, and other sedimentological features.\n2. Diatom analysis: Diatoms are microscopic algae that are sensitive to changes in their environment. The study analyzed the diatom assemblages to identify changes in the coastal environment, which could be indicative of past tsunami activity.\n3. Geochemical signatures: The researchers analyzed the geochemical composition of the sedimentary deposits to identify anomalies that could be related to tsunami activity.\n4. Historical records: The study also incorporated historical records of tsunami events, which helped to validate the results obtained from the proxy analysis.\n\nThese proxies were used to reconstruct the paleotsunami history in Mexico, providing valuable information for disaster management and emergency response planning in the region.\n\nI hope this information is accurate, clear, and helpful!",

This is evident from Document 2, which mentions that IMD issues various bulletins, including Tropical Cyclone Advisories, Tropical Cyclone Advisories for Civil Aviation, and Bulletins for India coasts.\n\nAdditionally, Document 2 also mentions that IMD has different divisions, such as the Cyclone Warning Division, which issues bulletins for India coasts, and the Marine Weather Services Division, which issues bulletins for the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS) and Fleet Forecast for Indian Navy. This suggests that IMD plays a crucial role in managing cyclonic hazards in India.\n\nFurthermore, Document 3 mentions that the AIR station should be requested to broadcast cyclone warnings at repeated hourly or half-hourly intervals, which further reinforces the role of IMD in managing cyclonic hazards.\n\nWhile the context does not explicitly state that IMD is responsible for managing cyclonic hazards, the information provided suggests that IMD plays a critical role in issuing warnings and advisories related to cyclonic hazards.\n\nActionable advice: It is essential for individuals living in cyclone-prone areas to stay informed about cyclone warnings and advisories issued by IMD.

The context documents primarily provide information about flood events, including the cause, location, duration, and severity of the events.\n\nHowever, based on my general knowledge, the four stages in the life cycle of a tropical cyclone are:\n\n1. **Tropical Disturbance**: A tropical cyclone forms when a tropical disturbance, an area of low pressure, develops over warm ocean waters. This stage is characterized by a cluster of thunderstorms and strong winds.\n\n2. **Tropical Depression**: If the tropical disturbance strengthens, it becomes a tropical depression, which is a rotating system of clouds and thunderstorms with sustained winds of 38 mph (61 km/h) or less.\n\n3. **Tropical Storm**: If the tropical depression strengthens further, it becomes a tropical storm, which is a rotating system of clouds and thunderstorms with sustained winds of 39-73 mph (63-118 km/h).\n\n4. **Hurricane/Typhoon**: If the tropical storm continues to strengthen, it becomes a hurricane or typhoon, which is a rotating system of clouds and thunderstorms with sustained winds of 74 mph (119 km/h) or higher.\n\nActionable advice: It's essential to monitor weather forecasts and warnings from trusted sources, such as the National Hurricane Center (NHC) or local meteorological agencies, to stay informed about tropical cyclones and potential threats.",

      "question": "What is ShakeMap used for?",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, ShakeMap is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I must rely on my general knowledge to answer this question.\n\nShakeMap is a product of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that provides a map of the intensity of shaking caused by an earthquake. It is used to estimate the severity of shaking and potential damage to buildings, infrastructure, and the environment. ShakeMap is typically generated within minutes of an earthquake and is used by emergency responders, researchers, and the general public to quickly assess the impact of an earthquake.\n\nWhile the context document from Ready.gov mentions earthquakes as one of the hazards, it does not specifically discuss ShakeMap or its uses.\n\nActionable advice: If you live in an earthquake-prone area, familiarize yourself with ShakeMap and how to access it in the event of an earthquake. This can help you quickly assess the situation and take necessary actions to protect yourself and your loved ones.",
