      "question": "What caused the tsunami event near E. Sporades Islands recorded in 330 B.C.?",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, the context documents do not provide information about a tsunami near E. Sporades Islands recorded in 330 B.C. The provided context documents only contain information about tsunami events that occurred between 1853 and 1933, and none of them mention the E. Sporades Islands.\n\nTherefore, I must rely on my general knowledge to provide an answer. According to historical records, the tsunami event near E. Sporades Islands in 330 B.C. is believed to have been triggered by an earthquake. However, I must emphasize that this information is not based on the provided context documents, but rather on general knowledge.\n\nIn the absence of specific information about this event, it is essential to rely on general knowledge and historical records to understand the causes of tsunami events. This highlights the importance of maintaining comprehensive and accurate records of natural disasters to improve our understanding of these events and enhance disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts.\n\nActionable advice: It is crucial to consult multiple sources, including historical records and scientific studies, to gather accurate information about natural disasters like tsunamis. This helps to improve our understanding of these events, enabling more effective disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.",

Bulletins issued by Cyclone Warning Division\" suggests that IMD has a dedicated division for cyclone warning, which further supports the notion that IMD is responsible for managing cyclonic hazards in India.\n\nIt is worth noting that ACWCs (Area Cyclone Warning Centres) and CWCs (Cyclone Warning Centres) also play a crucial role in managing cyclonic hazards, as mentioned in Document 1, which lists various ports under different ACWCs and CWCs. However, IMD appears to be the primary responsible for managing cyclonic hazards in India.\n\nActionable advice: In the event of a cyclonic hazard, it is essential to stay informed through official channels, such as IMD, ACWCs, and CWCs, and follow their instructions and warnings to ensure safety.",

However, I can supplement with my general knowledge on the topic.\n\nThe four stages in the life cycle of a tropical cyclone are:\n\n1. **Tropical Disturbance**: This is the initial stage where a low-pressure system forms, often as a result of warm waters and moisture. (General knowledge)\n2. **Tropical Depression**: If the disturbance strengthens, it becomes a tropical depression, characterized by sustained winds of 38 mph (61 km/h) or less. (General knowledge)\n3. **Tropical Storm**: If the tropical depression intensifies further, it becomes a tropical storm, with sustained winds of 39-73 mph (63-118 km/h). (General knowledge)\n4. **Hurricane/Typhoon**: The most intense stage, characterized by sustained winds of 74 mph (119 km/h) or higher. (General knowledge)\n\nIt's worth noting that the context documents provided do mention tropical cyclones as the cause of floods in several instances (Documents 1, 2, and 5), but they don't explicitly describe the life cycle of a tropical cyclone.\n\nActionable advice: When a tropical cyclone is forecasted to affect your area, stay informed about its progress, follow evacuation instructions, and take necessary precautions to ensure your safety.",

      "question": "What is ShakeMap used for?",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, ShakeMap is not mentioned in the given document from ready.gov. Therefore, I must rely on my general knowledge to answer this question.\n\nShakeMap is a product of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that provides near real-time maps of ground motion and shaking intensity following significant earthquakes. The maps are used to estimate the severity of shaking and potential impacts on people, buildings, and infrastructure.\n\nShakeMap is used for various purposes, including:\n\n1. Emergency response: To quickly assess the affected areas and prioritize response efforts.\n2. Damage assessment: To estimate the extent of damage to buildings, bridges, and other structures.\n3. Search and rescue operations: To identify areas with the highest likelihood of trapped people or significant damage.\n4. Infrastructure management: To assess the impact on critical infrastructure, such as power plants, hospitals, and transportation systems.\n\nWhile the provided context does not mention ShakeMap, it does emphasize the importance of preparing for earthquakes and other disasters. I would recommend visiting the USGS website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/tools/shakemap/) to learn about ShakeMap and its data can be used for disaster response and mitigation efforts.",
